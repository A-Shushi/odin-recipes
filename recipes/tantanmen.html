        <li>285 g ground pork (may also use ground beef, turkey, chicken, or

        <li>2 cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste), more or less to preference

        <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <strong>Toppings:</strong>

        <li>Leafy greens (bok choy, gai lan, or spinach)</li>
        <li>1 scallion, chopped</li>
        <li>Soft-boiled egg (you could also use ramen eggs, which should be prepared

        </li>
        <li>Chili oil, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong>Prepare the tare (seasoning base):</strong>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients together for the tare and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture evenly into two bowls and set aside.</li>
        <strong>Prepare the pork mixture:</strong>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add in the ground pork and cook until
            no
            longer pink, stirring frequently to avoid burning.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the ginger, garlic, and doubanjiang. Stir to coat the pork and saute
            until
            the aromatics are fragrant, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Stir to combine and continue cooking
            until
            most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 more minutes. Set aside and keep
            warm.
        </li>
        <strong>Prepare the broth:</strong>
        <li>In a sauce pot, combine together the chicken stock and non-dairy milk. Mix
            well.
        </li>
        <li>Bring to a low simmer, then cover and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
        <strong>Prepare the toppings:</strong>
        <li>To a pot of boiling water, blanch your leafy greens for about one minute or
            until
            bright green and tender. Remove from the water, drain, and reserve for
            assembly.
        </li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil again, and cook the ramen noodles according to
            packaged
            instructions until softened with a slight chew.
        </li>
        <strong>To assemble:</strong>
        <li>Divide the warmed broth between your two bowls. Mix well to evenly incorporate
            the
            tare with the broth.
        </li>
        <li>Add in a serving of ramen noodles to each bowl. Top with the ground pork
            mixture,
            blanched leafy greens, scallions, ramen egg, and a drizzle of chili oil, if
            desired. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
